                        birth and how they influence who you are fundamentally, your psyche. We also look into what you
                        can do to make better choices in areas you would like to see growth in. You will receive a
                        written analysis at the end.

                <p>I specialize in psychological astrology.</p>
                <p>
                    I began my spiritual journey as an atheist with an academic interest in religion. I was exposed to
                    different kinds of spiritual practice at an early age through my mother and from seeking it out on
                    my own. I chose my tools - astrology and tarot - and began to teach myself and eventually, I found
                    my own faith. After twelve years of practice, reading for myself everybody else that I met, I began
                    to read professionally in 2022. My personal spiritual practice has always been about awareness,
                    introspection and ultimately, growth in yourself. I do not look at astrology as a system of belief,
                    but rather, tools to help along this journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through these sessions, my goal is to help you understand yourself better and find clarity wherever
                    you need it. I aim to create a space free of judgment where you can be vulnerable with yourself. My
                    sessions are usually conversational and I see my role as a medium to help you communicate with the
                    universe.
